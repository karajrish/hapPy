I can hear peaceful music in the background as I stand atop a tower gazing into the vast world...taking in the creations. I feel the calmness and it takes me back. It reminds me of a time before fights...before disagreements got the better of us. It reminds me of a time when nothing mattered. It opens my eyes to a side of a person I never took the time to appreciate. A creative and magical side. As I traverse the halls and corridors crafted in a beautiful mind...I go back to smiles and laughter...long nights of creation and beauty found in the most unlikely of places. I open cabinets and chests to find the contents unbothered...as if waiting for their creator to return and put them all to good use. I find fruits and vegetables fully ripened and ready for picking but I leave them...because they were yours. I find projects unfinished...torn from their maturity because of selfishness and confusion. Confusion— because pride cometh before the fall but nobody ever talks about what happens after the fall. Never allowed to develop into their full potential because of me. It’s my fault. It was all so alive then but now the secret passages and unfinished towns are haunted by lack of companionship. It is calming in so many ways...and eye opening in so many ways. The journey takes me back to such a simpler time when it was just me...you...and Minecraft.',\n",
